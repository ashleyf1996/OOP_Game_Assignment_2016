* Assignment: Create a game in Processing

* My game: Fruit Fever

CONCEPT

- This is a game called Fruit Fever. Inspired by my love of fruit and my love of trying to escape enemies in games.
- This game consists of one level purposely, to test the abilty of the player to manoeuvre around the enemy to escape. 
- This game requires the player to carefully move skillfully around to escape the enemy and ensure they get all the fruit. 


DESIGN

- When thinking about the design of my game I wanted the game to have a simple approach for my player. 
- The player first see's the splash screen then the next level.
					
					design of the splash screen:
					- All of the features of the splash screen are inside or outside a border
					- The spash screen first has the name of the game Fruit Fever in special selected font with each letter a different colour
					- Their is a play button directly below the name of the game
					- towards the end of the screen i have 2 intuitive instructions : collect the fruit
																					  dodge the enemy 
					- This gives the player a forsight into how the game works.
					- on the left hand side of the border, i have the player move up and then the enemy. As they stop at their locations, text appears. The idea of this was to give the player a sense of what the player looks like, and what the enemy looks like. Also to make the player comfortable with the game's features. 
					- on the right hand side of the screen, i have fruit appearing from the bottom of the screen. This gives the player an idea of the fruit to expect in the game. Their are only 2 fruit, apples and oranges.

					design of the next level:

					- When the play button is clicked, the player only has a few seconds to move the player until the enemy comes
					- The first thing the player sees is the player a bear, which is located in the middle of the screen and the surrounding fruit
					- The player then sees the enemy coming from behind. 
					- The fruit is randomely placed around the screen, so each time the game is played the fruit is in a random place. This gives the player a sense of anticipation when playing it again.
					- their is a border around the board to give limitiations to the span of the generated fruit and the player. 
					- at the top of my screen, the words "Can you escape?" are on the left hand side. This makes the player want to escape even more as seeing them words make a player want to escape even more. On the right hand side, the players score is shown and incremented each time they collect fruit. 

					design of my player:

					- When trying to think of what "player" eats fruits, i thought of my things, However, I decided on a bear looking creature. Bears can be gentle berries aand fruit as well as meat comprise most of the bear's diet so it thought it would be fitting. I also told the player in the splash screen that this was a fruit eating bear.

					design of my enemy:

					- This is a made up creature of mine intended to look scary and "terrify" the player. 
- I selected the colours of my features very carefully to give the idea of a "tropic scene" as fruit is assoiciated with the tropics, with blue being my predominent colour.

FEATURES

Splash screen
- The purpose of a splash screen 
- The splash screen has a play button which allows the user to play the game 
- The fruit in the game are moving up the right hand side to give the enemy an idea of the fruit that is going to be in the game.
-The player and the enemy move up the other side of the screen 

Level 1

- The enemies follows the player constantly 
- When the Player touches fruit their score is incremented. When the player touches an orange, their score increments by 1, and if they touch and apple it increments by 5.

Win/Lose screens
